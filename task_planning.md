# Task Planning for File Browser Application

## Product requirements

### Core requirements

1. ‚úÖ Select a file/directory: Clicking on a file or directory ‚Äúselects‚Äù it (useful for other operations, below).
1. ‚úÖ Create a new file/directory: The current selected directory is the parent and the user should be required to name the new file/directory.
1. ‚úÖ Expand a directory: Clicking on a directory‚Äôs ‚ÄúExpand‚Äù button should reveal all the files and directories contained inside. Clicking again should ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù the view.
1. ‚úÖ Remove a file/directory: Remove the selected file or directory.
1. ‚úÖ Example button: Create 10K files/directories (there should be some nested element). This will be used during the demo.

### Recommended Extensions - complete at least 1

1. ‚úÖ Move a file/directory: Move an existing file or directory into another directory. It can happen using drag and drop for example.
1. ‚úÖ Find a file/directory: Given a filename, find all the files and directories that have exactly that name.
1. ‚úÖ Restrict to a subtree: restrict the search to the selected directory
1. ‚úÖ Files have the correct icon: Every known file extension will have an associated icon.
1. ‚úÖ Drill down / roll up view: Make the selected directory the root in the current view and going back
1. ‚úÖ Multiple views: Users may create additional ‚Äúviews‚Äù of the same file system (in the same browser window). Users may independently browse in each view. Users may use drag and drop between views.
1. ‚úÖ Download weather for a city specified in the file name: The file is going to be the name of the city that we want to know the weather for (with ‚Äú.city‚Äù extension). For example ‚Äúlondon.city‚Äù should initiate a download of the weather json file for that city. You can use the api https://openweathermap.org/current.
1. Responsive design: Your frontend works just as well on small-screen formats (i.e. mobile) as it does on a full-sized screen (i.e laptop browser).
1. ‚úÖ Multiselect: Users may select multiple files / directories (i.e shift-select). Extend existing functions (e.g remove) to support multi-select.
1. ‚úÖ File/directory info: Selecting a file/directory displays useful information about the selected item.

### Personal extensions

Extra features I would like to implement if time permits:

1. ‚úÖ Playwright automation testing
1. ‚úÖ List virtualization: Implement list virtualization techniques to ensure smooth scrolling and interaction of 10k items
1. ‚úÖ Breadcrumbs
1. ‚úÖ Expand/Collapse all
1. ‚úÖ Navigation history (navigate back)
1. ‚úÖ Move files with drag-and-drop into a breadcrumb
1. ‚úÖ Show move progress (generator function)
1. ‚úÖ Resolve move conflicts (skip/replace/cancel) using a generator function
1. ‚úÖ Undo a move, delete, or add operation with ctrl-z
1. ‚úÖ Type/name sorting
1. ‚úÖ Put file generation function into a web worker to avoid blocking the main thread, and have it cache the generated structure in local storage for faster subsequent generations.
1. Move selected files with toolbar button which opens dialog with a directory navigator so user can move files across many levels quickly
1. Dark mode
1. Report code coverage for Playwright tests (turns out this is a headache to set up and not worth the effort for this demo).

### Test Coverage Summary

The e2e tests cover the following key functionality:

- ‚úÖ **Navigation**: Breadcrumb navigation, up/back buttons
- ‚úÖ **File Operations**: Create, delete, move files and directories
- ‚úÖ **Drag & Drop**: Between directories, between views, onto breadcrumbs
- ‚úÖ **Multi-View**: Independent views with synchronized changes
- ‚úÖ **Selection**: Single and multi-select with shift-click
- ‚úÖ **Search**: File filtering with real-time results
- ‚úÖ **Weather Integration**: Download weather data for .city files
- ‚úÖ **Sorting**: By type and name, with asc/desc toggle
- ‚úÖ **Undo**: Full undo support for create, delete, and move operations
- ‚úÖ **Expand/Collapse**: Individual and bulk directory operations
- ‚úÖ **Move Conflicts**: Conflict resolution with Replace/Skip/Cancel options

### Missing Test Coverage

- Responsive design testing
- Error handling scenarios
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility

### Technical Notes

- FileNode: class representing a file or directory.
- FileSystem:
  - Stores file information in a tree structure
  - Contains methods for manipulating the file system (create, delete, move, search). Create, delete, and move operations are naturally O(1), but we check for name conflicts on moves making them O(n) in the worst case.
  - Extends EventTarget to notify view of changes to which directories are being added to or removed from.
    - FileSystemView only needs to re-render if the current context node (the directory being viewed) is a parent of any of the directory nodes being added to or removed from, as indicated by the details of the event.
    - This approach was chosen over a more "React-centric" way of state management using React built-ins like `useState`, `useSelector`, or Redux, because the slice of state we are listening to can _change_ as we navigate through the directories.
- FileSystemView: Binds to a FileSystem instance and renders the current context node (directory) and its children. Contains components for navigating, selecting, creating, deleting, moving, searching, and sorting files/directories.
